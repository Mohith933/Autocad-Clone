# 📐 AutoCAD Web Clone (Frontend)

**AutoCAD Web Clone** is a **frontend-only drawing application** inspired by AutoCAD’s web interface.
The project focuses on **canvas-based drawing, UI controls, and interaction logic**, not full CAD precision.

This is a **learning and showcase project**, built to demonstrate frontend engineering skills.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project recreates the **basic experience of AutoCAD Web** using browser technologies.

The goal is to:

* Understand canvas-based drawing systems
* Build tool-driven UI interactions
* Practice coordinate handling and mouse events
* Design a clean technical interface

> ⚠️ This is **not a full AutoCAD replacement**.

## ✨ Features

### 🖊 Drawing Tools

* Line tool
* Rectangle tool
* Circle tool
* Freehand sketching

### 🎯 Canvas Interaction

* Mouse-based drawing
* Real-time shape rendering
* Basic coordinate tracking

### 🧰 Tool Panel

* Tool selection UI
* Clear / reset canvas
* Simple interaction feedback

### 💻 Web-Based Experience

* Runs fully in the browser
* No installation required
* Desktop-focused layout (similar to AutoCAD Web)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**
* **HTML Canvas API**

No backend, no database, no external libraries.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

* Keep logic understandable
* Focus on core drawing mechanics
* Avoid over-engineering
* Make the code easy to explain in interviews

---

## ⚠ Limitations

* No layers
* No snapping or measurements
* No export (DXF/DWG)
* No undo/redo
* No precision constraints

These limitations are **intentional** for a frontend learning project.

---

## 📌 Why This Project?

This project exists to:

* Practice canvas & geometry handling
* Demonstrate frontend interaction logic
* Show understanding of technical UI tools
* Avoid heavy CAD mathematics or backend complexity

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements (Optional)

* Undo / redo
* Grid snapping
* Shape editing
* Export as image or SVG
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Zoom & pan
